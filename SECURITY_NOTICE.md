# 🔐 CRITICAL SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED

## ⚠️ **Rotate Your Supabase API Keys Immediately**

During our conversation, your Supabase API keys were temporarily visible and need to be rotated for security.

---

## 🚨 What Keys Were Exposed?

- ✅ `SUPABASE_URL` - Safe (this is public anyway)
- ⚠️ `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - **ROTATE THIS**
- 🔴 `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` - **ROTATE THIS URGENTLY** (full admin access!)

---

## 📋 How to Rotate Keys (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Supabase Dashboard

Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ielwxcdoejxahmdsfznj/settings/api

### Step 2: Rotate Both Keys

In the **"Project API keys"** section:

1. **anon public key:**
   - Click the **"Rotate"** button next to it
   - Copy the NEW key
   
2. **service_role secret key:**
   - Click the **"Rotate"** button next to it
   - Copy the NEW key

### Step 3: Update Keys in Replit

1. Click **"Tools"** → **"Secrets"** in Replit
2. Find `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → Edit → Paste new anon key
3. Find `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → Edit → Paste new service key
4. Restart your Replit app

### Step 4: Update Keys in Vercel (If Already Deployed)

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Edit `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` → Paste new anon key
5. Edit `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` → Paste new service key
6. Go to **Deployments** → Click **"Redeploy"**

## ✅ After Rotation

Once you've rotated both keys and updated them everywhere:

- ✅ Old keys are invalidated (anyone who saw them can't use them)
- ✅ Your database is secure again
- ✅ Your app works with new keys
- ✅ You're ready to deploy safely!

---

## 🎯 Why This Matters

**Service Role Key = Full Database Admin Access**
- Can bypass all security rules
- Can read/write/delete ANY data
- Must NEVER be exposed publicly

By rotating, you ensure that even if the old key was seen, it's now useless!

## ⏱️ This Takes 2 Minutes

Don't skip this! Rotating keys is quick and ensures your database stays secure.

**After rotating:** You're all set for safe deployment! 🚀
