Current Situation:
Storage Problem: Your app uses temporary memory storage - all data is lost when the server restarts! This is a critical issue.
No Admin Panel: There's no way for you to view or export team data
Slot System: Currently tracking 25 slots, but needs database support for accurate updates

View all registered teams
Download team data in Excel format (only you can access this)

Real-time Slot Updates - Accurate slot availability that updates instantly across all users

Enhanced Features:

Admin login/authentication
Team status tracking (pending/approved/rejected)
Better dashboard with analytics
Responsive design for mobile/desktop
Export to Excel with all team details including payment screenshots
Security:

Admin-only routes protected
Secure authentication
Excel export only accessible to admin
