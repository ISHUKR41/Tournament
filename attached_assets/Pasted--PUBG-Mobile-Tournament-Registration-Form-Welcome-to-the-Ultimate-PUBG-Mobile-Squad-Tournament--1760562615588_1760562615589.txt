⚙️ Automatic Form Closing After 25 Teams

Unfortunately, Google Forms doesn’t automatically close after 25 submissions by default, but you can set it up easily like this:

Option 1 (Manual – Easy Method):

Once 25 teams have registered and paid, simply:

Go to Google Form → Responses tab

Toggle off “Accepting responses”
This will close the form instantly and show your custom message like:

“Registration is now closed! All 25 team slots have been filled. Thank you for your interest!”

Option 2 (Automatic – Smart Method using Add-on):

You can use a free Google Forms Add-on called “FormLimiter” that automatically closes your form after 25 submissions.
Here’s how:

Open your Google Form.

Click on the three dots (⋮) → choose Add-ons.

Search for “FormLimiter” and install it.

After installing, click the puzzle icon (Add-ons) → FormLimiter → Set limit.

Choose “Limit by number of responses.”

Set Limit = 25.

Add a custom closing message like:

“All 25 slots are filled. Registration is now closed. Stay tuned for the next tournament!”

After that, your form will automatically stop accepting responses once 25 teams have successfully registered.

⚠️ Important Notes

Once registration is confirmed, your team will be added to the official WhatsApp group for match updates.

No refund after registration — please join on time.

Match schedule, timing, and rules will be shared in the WhatsApp group.

If any team fails to join the match lobby on time, their slot will be given to a standby team (if available).

🏁 Good Luck, Warriors!

Sharpen your aim, plan your drops, and lead your squad to victory.
