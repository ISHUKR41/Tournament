# Vercel Deployment Guide - Quick Start

## ‚úÖ Your App is Ready for Vercel!

All necessary changes have been completed. Follow these steps to deploy:

---

## Step 1: Environment Variables

In your Vercel project dashboard, go to **Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables** and add:

### Required Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=your-neon-database-url
SESSION_SECRET=your-random-secret-at-least-32-characters
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Optional (for real-time features):
```
PUSHER_APP_ID=your-pusher-app-id
PUSHER_KEY=your-pusher-key
PUSHER_SECRET=your-pusher-secret
PUSHER_CLUSTER=ap2
VITE_PUSHER_KEY=your-pusher-key
VITE_PUSHER_CLUSTER=ap2
```

**Note**: Pusher variables are optional. The app works without them but won't have real-time slot updates.

---

## Step 2: Generate SESSION_SECRET

Run this command to generate a secure secret:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Copy the output and use it as your `SESSION_SECRET`.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "SESSION_SECRET not set" error
- Make sure you added `SESSION_SECRET` in Vercel environment variables
- Redeploy after adding it

### "Database connection failed"
- Verify `DATABASE_URL` is correct (should be Neon database URL)
- Make sure it starts with `postgresql://` or `postgres://`

### Form still slow on mobile
- Clear your browser cache
- The new deployment has removed all animations
- Form should load instantly now

---

## üìä Expected Performance

- **Build Time**: ~20-30 seconds
- **Form Load**: Instant (animations removed)
- **Image Upload**: ~2-3 seconds (with compression)
- **API Response**: <500ms
